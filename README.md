[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eunice12jk/car-class-lab.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eunice12jk/car-class-lab)
### Car Class

You are to create a Car class that can be used to instantiate various vehicles.

It takes in arguments that depict the type, model, and name of the vehicle, provided they are set.

Let the test guide you to building your Car boiler plate.

### How to Run this Lab

Fork this Repository, then Clone forked repository Open the file named car.py and start coding
### Notes

Prior understanding of Python classes are required, returning, and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make it.

Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
